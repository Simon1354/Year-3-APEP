# Year-3-APEP
This is the development code for my year 3 APEP project at Manchester Medical School, University of Manchester. In this project I develop a neural network to predict surviving fractions of cells at different radiation doses from clonogenic assays.
This project aims to better model and predict SF in uder to aid the undersatanding of the true relative biological effect value for protons.
